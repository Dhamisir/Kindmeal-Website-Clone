For restaurants that do not require advance reservations, you can even use the LiveCoupon immediately! After all, eating is an impulsive decision, right?</Text>
                <Text m="20px 0px" fontSize="3xl">How do I get a KindMeal coupon?</Text>
                <Text>Just browse to a deal you like, select the corresponding outlet location (if the restaurant has multiple locations), then click on Get Coupon. Please note that the outlet location cannot be changed after the coupon is obtained.
                    Each member is limited to 5 active coupons only. You must use the coupons before you can obtain additional ones. Unused coupons will automatically expire upon reaching its due date.</Text>

                    For deals with KindWords enabled, you can enjoy DOUBLE the discount if you share the deal on Facebook or Twitter. Once you successfully share it, you will immediately receive the exclusive discount for your deal. If you prefer not to take advantage of KindWords, you can still proceed to get the deal at the normal discount price. Please note that not all deals support KindWords - it depends on the merchant.</Text>
                <Text m="20px 0px" fontSize="3xl">What if I don't have a mobile device or Internet connection, can I use a Print Coupon?</Text>
                <Text>This depends on the specific deal. If the merchant allows it, you can also choose to print out the coupon and bring it along. Please refer to the deal's Terms & Conditions to check if print coupons are allowed, and if any prior reservation and usage delay are required.
                    To print your coupon, first access it via KindMeal website at the Account. My Coupons section, then click on Print Coupon at the corresponding coupon. If the Print Coupon button is not available, it means that only LiveCoupons are accepted for the deal.</Text>
                <Text m="20px 0px" fontSize="3xl">What is a Print Coupon's Usage Delay?</Text>
                <Text>Some merchants may not have the facilities available to verify Print Coupons instantly, so they may impose a Usage Delay of a certain number of days to first print out a cross-checking reference list. If there is a 3-Day delay, it means that you can only use the Print Coupon 3 days after obtaining the coupon.
                    You may wish to check with the merchant first before using it. We strongly suggest using a LiveCoupon instead, which is immediate with no usage delays.</Text>
